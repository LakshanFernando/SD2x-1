# Homework 1 - Linked Lists

In this assignment you will implement three methods that perform functions on a linked list, using the java.util.LinkedList class from the Java Collections API.

In completing this assignment, you will:

- Become familiar with the methods in the java.util.LinkedList class
- Apply what you have learned about how linked lists store data
- Demonstrate that you can use linked lists to solve data-related problems

## Getting Started
Download the [LinkedListUtils.java](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/276899496d83bbfb170d072d6eb754be/asset-v1:PennX+SD2x+2T2017+type@asset+block/LinkedListUtils.java) file, which contains the unimplemented methods for the code that you will write in this assignment.

## Activity
Implement the following methods in the **LinkedListUtils.java** file:

**insertSorted:** This method assumes the input LinkedList is already sorted in non-descending order (i.e.,such that each element is greater than or equal to the one that is before it, and inserts the input **int** value into the correct location of the list. Note that the method does not return anything, but rather modifies the input LinkedList as a side effect. If the input LinkedList is null, this method should simply terminate.

**removeMaximumValues:** This method removes all instances of the N largest **values** in the LinkedList. Because the values are Strings, you will need to use the String classâ€™ **compareTo** method to find the largest elements; see the Java API for help with that method. If the input LinkedList is null or if N is non-positive, this method should simply return without any modifications to the input LinkedList. Keep in mind that if any of the N largest values appear more than once in the LinkedList, this method should return remove all instances, so it may remove more than N elements overall. The other elements in the LinkedList should not be modified and their order must not be changed.

**containsSubsequence:** This method determines whether any part of the first LinkedList contains all elements of the second in the same order with no other elements in the sequence, i.e. it should return true if the second LinkedList is a subsequence of the first, and false if it is not. The method should return false if either input is null or empty.
